## [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) 

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code.
Each folder contains:

- daily challenge ```readme.md```
- challenge input file ```input.txt```
- php files for each part of the challenge.

### Requirements

- git
- php 8.1
- composer
- a terminal window :)
- advent of code account

### Installation

As simple as running 

```
git clone git@github.com:alexlungu/adventofcode2021.git 
cd adventofcode2021
composer install
```

### Input files

All input files are unique for each participant, overwrite the `input.txt` file in each folder before running the scripts.
